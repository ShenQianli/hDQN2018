# An Empirically Study of Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning  

This is a course project for **Reinforcement Learning: Theory and Algorithms**, School of Mathematical Sciences,  Peking University, 2018 spring.  

In this project we implemented two reinforcement learning environment with sparse rewards, **Discrete Stochastic Dicision Process** and **Maze Game**.

Run corresponding python files to train DQN, hDQN or hDQNm for tasks.

Results and more details in report.
